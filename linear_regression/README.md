# Linear regression
The Linear Regression Algorithm uses a mathematical concept of derivative calculation to perform the predictive model

Then when we deliver the data it will use a mathematical formula to find the value of the derivative for all variables present in the delivered data, except the one that is our target.

As a result of this calculation we'll have the drawing of a line and three important values: 

	1. The Slope: Indicate the line angle , 
	2. Intercept: indicate the line position in the chat (bellow or before) from X axis
    3. Score: Indicate the percentage of error that we have in our model
