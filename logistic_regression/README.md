# Logistic Regression

Like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression wants to find a number that explains a probability of a fact being true or not.

But while Linear Regression tries to do it through the number found itself, which can be a random number between zero and infinity, Logistic Regression obtains the number found, which in this case also is random, but between zero and one, and if the number is close to one there is more probability of fact is true, conversely, if the number is close to zero, there is more probability of fact is false.

For this the Linear Regression algorithm will need to use the Sigmoid function which has the responsibility of sorting the data between 0 and 1 and after that the cost function will use to Logarithm function to validate the error for the cost function and help us to know how far we are of the correct classification.
