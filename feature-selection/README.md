# Feature Selection

## One hot encoding
When we are working with datasets usually we came across situations where a column that represents an important value to our model as a text, and as we know always that we working with ML algorithm we'll convert from text to numbers. In some cases our text variable will have only two one or two categories like the variable gender, for example, but in most cases the text variable will have several values and just replace the texts to 0 or 1 don't would solve our problem. For cenarious like that Python offers support to the technique known as One-Hot Encoding the help us to convert categorized data into a numerical representation, binary values (0, 1).

[Here]() you can see an example of this technique.
